# Fallow Crow
```
    Silvan Crow was an assistant to a powerful, but introverted, wizard.
He originally came to the Wizard as an apprentice, but soon it was obvious
that despite being quite smart and very driven, Silvan had no magical talent.
    No Matter how hard he studied, no matter how much he learned and
researched, he could not enact from the ether the power to cast even the
simplest spell. In spite of this lack of ability, he found the wizard so
endearing, good hearted, and loyalty inspiring, that he agreed to stay on as
his assistant and to support the wizard in his endeavors for as long as he could.
    It was some years later when a group came through their small village in the
middle of the night. They came shouting for the wizard, overpowered him with both
magic and force, ask for information. Demanded in a strange language...something...but
what it was Silvan could not understand. Instead of answering, the wizard with a
regretful glance to Silvan, muttered a quiet spell and self immolated in torturous
agony until all that remained collapsed into a pile of ashes.
    The group was so enraged at the loss of the wizard, their failure to get whatever
information it was they wanted, that they took Silvan and buried him alive in the cold
winter ground. In shock from the death of the wizard and from finding himself buried in
a box...dying slowly of the cold and a lack of air....he swore in the darkness that
surrounded him that if he was given the chance he would have his vengeance should
anything listening care to grant him that boon.
    What Silvan didn’t know was that Larloch the Shadow King was watching, not out of
randomness, but of all things because he owed a debt to the wizard from long ago.
Despite being aligned so differently, the wizard had aided Larloch in a matter of
honor and since that day, he had sworn he would one day make good on his debt.
    Larloch granted Silvan his boon. He would grant him the power to pursue his
vengeance for its own sake. *With only one string attached.* It would seem that
Larloch was fond of the old wizard regardless of what he referred to as “the wizards'
worse-than-neutral tendencies”.
    From the day he crawled his way out of that cold frozen ground, he went by the
name Fallow Crow. He never quite warmed up completely, never quite felt fully alive
again, but it didn’t matter. Inside him burned an ice cold flame...vengeance would
be his…one day…no matter how long it took. He would find them and send them all
down to some place worse that they could imagine.
    And on this long road to finding these killers...should he come across any other
circumstances of unsettled vengeance? Well, he could do that too. That was the one string
attached...Fallow Crow's debt to the Shadow King...he would become vengeance personified
where ever he found it needed.

(Sahaar: I think that either Fallow Crow is either passing though the village shortly after the death of Lady Lucia and the need for vengeance on her part is a tie in for him, or possibly he had passed through before and become aquainted with her and felt a loyalty to her because of some experience they had had in the past[a previous quest. One aided the other? Possibly after metting out vengeance nearby he was wounded and she healed him. Or maybe she knew of someone who was guilty of very heinous things, but had gotten away with them, and they needed dealing with in a way that her Cleric beliefs didn't allow her to. So Fallow handled it for her in a particularly Fallow way.] I am flexible)
