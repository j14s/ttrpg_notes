# Heading to Tser Pool

### Pre

We talked with Irena and kindly refused the donkey from the big guy.

### Travel

- We travel for a bit.
- Cross bridge
- The forest closes in. It smells of of damp earth and repression.
  - We encounter a felmale woman with companion
  - They are looking for Langstons
- After some travel, Wojtek stops.
  - Gami wonders where Wojtek is?
  - Wojtek's eyes are closed...very still.
    - "There is a lake, I failed. I must save the forest" "I am not Wojtek. that is not my name"
    - Irena smacks W all around to wake him up.
    - W doesn't remember anything from during the trance.
- A scream:
  - Harry hears the directions...
  - We run after it, Cinter and Irena in the lead
  - We come across a figure in a fetal ball.
  - 4 undead zombie children come out of the forest
  - we run?
    - no! We fight
    - stuff happens
    - we are doing well...I kill the momma.
    - we run...BUT, OH NOES!...into the BBEG for this encounter but all the other dead are turned.
    - Lots of running, and some sacrificial attackes and Z gets the kill
      - W00f and w00t!
- We arrive at the crossroads
  - To the north west is tser pool
  - to the south ewst is ravenloft
  - A gallows and graveyard is nearby.
  - I know a carraige is arriving, I send everyone but G, Irena, and myself to the woods to hide
  - A giant black carriage arrives.
    - Its probably the real BBEG.
      - He knwos everyone else is hiding
      - He calls everyone out
    - It's Straad.
      - Man, he is a douche.
    - He calls a wolf as big as Wojtec out of the woods!!!!

And we end there!!!!
