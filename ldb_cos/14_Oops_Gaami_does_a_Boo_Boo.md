# oops, Gaami does a BOO-BOO!!

### Preset

Spent a night at Tserpool and in the morning they start dealing some business with Pedro.

### Business with Pedro

- Everyone is chilling, waiting & Iggy gives items
  - Zenphyra gets a book about History of Barovia, of a time of long ago - of the first people lived here.
  But he lends the book to her, he asks to return it safely.
  - Gaami gets a pheromones to attract Wolves and a scroll to talk to animal
  - Harry takes a Coffee grinder, a book, an instrument made of bones of a giant.
  Also lures him in selling him a clear mysterious liquid. Also buys rope, pitons and also two short sword.
  - Cinter gets a chain mail and healing potions
  - Wojtek takes a sheath and get a hammer for himself. He gets very happy with his new weapon.


### Cinter seems himself dead

- As soon as we walk towards Vallaki, when you reach the crossroads
  - Cinter sees a skinless horse and a skeleton rider with lanterns shedding no light.
  - Everyone sees these horse and rider through the mist. Cinter,Harry, Gaami, Zenphyra stay on the way - while Wojtek and Iggy hides.
  - They all just let the horses pass by. Irina pushes everyone to make way to Vallaki instead of following those riders.
  - The party starts heading to West. However, Cinter leaves in the end, as the feeling of dread did not leave him.
  - He sees one last time towards gallows to find a deadboy swinging.
  - He calls Harry over and asks if Harry sees the deadbody and Cinter approaches the gallows.
  - He stops as he approaches, fear takes over him when he sees the deadbody closer, he says - "Its me!"

### Treacherous Path - Old Tower

- The party reaches to this old three storied tower
  - Zenphyra, Gaami looks at the tower and first decide not to enter into
  - Iggy investigates and goes through the deadbodies with Cinter, sees a rotten Wolf.
  - Zenphyra sees a broken silver pendant, carved like a dragon. She touches it and learns something
  - Irina and Gaami exchange some talk about why the party stops everywhere
  - Cinter goes into the tower, to learn its falling apart. He comes out of the tower and says - what are we waiting for, lets go!

### Down the road - Motion
- After a while on their journey, Cinter spots a motion
  - Gaami tries to also investigate and maybe it is a wolf
  - As soon as Gaami thinks it might be a wolf, he sprints towards the motion
  - He does not see any animal in partcular, but without the party knowing he rubs some pheromones on him
  - Wojtek also investigates the foot prints and with some deduction they all realize they must be of a pack of wolves

### Road gets narrower
- Irina convinces Gaami to continue along with the party
  - Gaami starts having an emotional converstion with Irina on their journey
  - As he realizes that he fucked up, he comes out to the party that he did use the Pheromones
  - When he was confessing, the party sees 6 wolves coming out of the shadows.

And we end there!!!! Literally a CLIFF HANGER <Wink> <Wink>
